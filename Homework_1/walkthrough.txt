We downloaded the map from OpenStreetMap (https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=13/45.3303/14.4584). 
We installed the OsmConvert.exe application file (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmconvert) and converted "rijeka.osm" to "rijeka.o5m" through the command line from the same folder.

Later, by following the guides in the cmd for file conversion from .osm to .o5m format.
We installed OsmFilter.exe , and used the "osmfilter" command with pipes to filter the data and export it to .csv file.

osmfilter rijeka.o5m --keep="amenity=parking" | osmconvert - --all-to-nodes --csv="@id addr:city name addr:street @lat @lon" --csv-headline --csv-separator="," -o="parking.csv"

With the command above we keep the data for all the parkings, more specifically their ID, address, city, name, latitude, and longitude in the file named parking.csv.
